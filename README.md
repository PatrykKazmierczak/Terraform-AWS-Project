# Terraform-AWS-Project

Project Description 🚀
This project involves building a cloud-based infrastructure using Terraform for managing resources on AWS. The primary components include:

Frontend 🌐: An index.html file, serving as the main entry point for a web-based user interface.
Backend 🖥️: Implemented with AWS Lambda, providing serverless functions for the application.
API Gateway 🌉: A gateway for exposing the backend to external users through HTTP endpoints.
DynamoDB 📊: A NoSQL database used for persistent data storage, configured through Terraform.
S3 ☁️: Used for storage, possibly hosting static assets for the frontend or acting as a data store for the backend.
Terraform ⚙️: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is managed with multiple .tf files to provision and maintain resources, including S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and Lambda.
.gitignore 🚫: Configured to exclude unnecessary or sensitive files from the repository.
backend.zip 📦: Contains the Lambda function code, updated to handle backend processing and business logic.
The project has an active development flow, with recent updates to the frontend and backend, ensuring that both API and Terraform variables are kept current.

Goal 🎯: To deploy a scalable and serverless web application on AWS, leveraging cloud services like Lambda for compute, DynamoDB for storage, and API Gateway for communication.
